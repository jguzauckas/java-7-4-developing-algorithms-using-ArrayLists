# Developing Algorithms Using ArrayLists

In this section we will discuss common algorithms used with ArrayLists.

This section covers the following material:

- New to `ArrayList` Objects
    - Inserting Elements
    - Deleting Elements
- Array Algorithms Modified
    - Minimum
    - Maximum
    - Sum
    - Average
    - Mode
    - An Element with a Property
    - All Elements with a Property
    - Access All Consecutive Pairs of Elements
    - Determine the Presence or Absence of Duplicate Elements
    - Determine the Number of Elements Meeting Criteria
    - Shift Elements Left/Right
    - Reverse the Order of Elements
- Traversing Multiple `ArrayList` Objects Simultaneously
